# EchoLink - To Do Tasks

This directory contains detailed specifications for future EchoLink features and enhancements.

## Current Tasks

### 1. File Monitoring System
**File**: `1-file-monitoring-system.md`  
**Priority**: High  
**Effort**: ~8-12 hours  

Replace clipboard monitoring with file-based monitoring for more reliable Cursor AI integration. This eliminates manual copying and enables true automation.

**Key Benefits:**
- Fully automated workflow
- No manual Cmd+C required
- More reliable than clipboard monitoring
- Can filter different types of content

### 2. Two-Way Voice Communication  
**File**: `2-two-way-voice-communication.md`  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Effort**: ~12-17 hours  

Add speech-to-text capability so users can speak back to Cursor, completing the conversation loop.

**Key Benefits:**
- Truly hands-free operation
- Natural conversation flow
- Multiple speech recognition options
- Privacy-focused design

## Implementation Order

**Recommended sequence:**
1. **File Monitoring** (higher impact, easier implementation)
2. **Two-Way Voice** (more complex, requires additional dependencies)

## Status Legend
- üìã **Planned**: Specification complete, ready for implementation
- üöß **In Progress**: Currently being developed
- ‚úÖ **Complete**: Feature implemented and tested
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Paused**: Development temporarily stopped
- ‚ùå **Cancelled**: Feature cancelled or deprioritized

## Current Status
- File Monitoring System: üìã **Planned**
- Two-Way Voice Communication: üìã **Planned**

## Contributing

When working on these features:
1. Review the full specification before starting
2. Update status in this README when beginning work
3. Follow existing code patterns and security practices
4. Add comprehensive tests for new functionality
5. Update main README.md when features are complete

## Notes

- Both features are designed to integrate cleanly with existing EchoLink architecture
- Security and privacy considerations are built into each specification
- Each task includes detailed implementation steps and testing plans
- Features can be implemented independently or in combination
