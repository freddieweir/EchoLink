# EchoLink

My personal tool to turn Cursor's AI chatter into voice summaries so I can actually listen to what it's saying.

## What it does

- Listens to whatever Cursor's AI is spitting out
- Makes sense of it and summarizes the important bits
- Reads it back to me using ElevenLabs voice API
- Basically lets me "hear" my coding sessions

## Future Plans

**Two-way voice conversation with Cursor:**
- I speak back to EchoLink
- It converts my voice to text using speech-to-text
- Sends that text directly to Cursor as if I typed it myself
- Creates a full voice-only coding workflow

Basically turning Cursor into a voice assistant I can have actual conversations with while coding.

## How it'll work

1. **Listen**: Captures Cursor's AI responses
2. **Summarize**: Makes the responses conversational 
3. **Speak**: Reads it to me via ElevenLabs
4. **Listen to me**: Records my voice response
5. **Send back**: Converts my speech to text and sends to Cursor
6. **Repeat**: Keeps the conversation going
