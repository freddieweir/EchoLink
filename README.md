# EchoLink

My personal tool to turn Cursor's AI chatter into voice summaries so I can actually listen to what it's saying.

## What it does

- Listens to whatever Cursor's AI is spitting out
- Makes sense of it and summarizes the important bits
- Reads it back to me using ElevenLabs voice API
- Basically lets me "hear" my coding sessions
